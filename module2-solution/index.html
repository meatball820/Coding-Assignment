    <div id="1">Pansies</div>
    <div id="2">Winter-flowering pansies are a gardener’s staple – ideal for filling pots and window boxes for a flash of colour to be seen from indoors.</div>
    <div id="3">Cyclamen</div>
    <div id="4">Cyclamen are winter heroes that can be brought to flower from autumn to spring. The flowers come in red, pink and white shades and look fantastic in pots or planted under trees.</div>
    <div id="5">Snowdrops</div>
    <div id="6">Snowdrops can be the first flowers to open in the new year and grow happily under trees and shrubs. Look for Galanthus nivalis for a woodland style, and elegant G. ‘Magnet’ for flowers that dance in the breeze.</div>
