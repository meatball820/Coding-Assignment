                Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of
                raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout
                the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

                Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and
                boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century,
                prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful
                than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.[2]

                The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across
                different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive
                farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques.
                The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber
                humans more than two to one.[3]
                Kung Pao chicken (Chinese: 宫保鸡丁), also transcribed as Gong Bao or Kung Po, is a spicy, stir-fried
                Chinese dish made with chicken, peanuts, vegetables (traditionally leek only), and chili peppers. The
                classic dish in Sichuan cuisine originated in the Sichuan Province of south-western China and includes
                Sichuan peppercorns. Although the dish is found throughout China, there are regional variations that are
                typically less spicy than the Sichuan serving. Kung Pao chicken is also a staple of Westernized Chinese
                cuisine.
